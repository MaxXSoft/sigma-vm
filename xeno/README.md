# Xeno Programming Language

Xeno is a novel programming language designed to:

* Functional programming, generic typing, flexible macro system and so on.
* Supported both garbage collector and manual memory management.
* Coroutines and auto-parallelisation.
* High performance powered by Sigma VM.

> All of the above are unrealistic imagination.
>
> But at least, we have created a new blank `lib.rs` file.

##  Roadmap

* [ ] **Parsing:** lexer/parser without macro support.
* [ ] **Basic syntax:** import, static, function definitions without implicit parameters, primitive types, array types, let, loop, while, if, return, array expression, call.
* [ ] **More syntax:** TBD.
* [ ] **Macros:** TBD.
